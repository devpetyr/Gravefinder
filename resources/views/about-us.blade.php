                  Hello & Welcome, I am Barbara Noreck Ruppert, I’ve compiled
                  this collection of images & maps of the Saint Stanislaus
                  Cemetery located just outside of Buffalo New York to help you
                  to reconnect with lost loved ones. Over the past few years I
                  have photographed, mapped, the headstones as well as indexed
                  75,500 burials so far. This is only meant as a guide. I don’t
                  have access to St. Stanislaus 3×5 cards that may contain
                  additional information and I do NOT update burials per section
                  once I have finished the area. Death certificates tell you
                  exactly which cemetery your ancestors are buried at and is the
                  best reference.

                  I began my fascinating journey working on my own family’s
                  genealogy. Genealogists always end up looking for gravestones
                  in order to find every tidbit of information on past family
                  members. I put a request on “Find A Grave” for a photograph of
                  a gravestone for my 2x great grand Uncle Alexander Belford. He
                  was born in co. Kerry, Ireland, immigrated to Canada, and died
                  in California. My 2x great grandfather William had one son but
                  died young at 28 from T.B. William’s 3 brothers established
                  the “Belford Publishing co.” In 1883 their Chicago office
                  burned to the ground and this tragedy was listed in newspapers
                  from Toronto to Buffalo and Illinois. The Belford siblings
                  went from their parents dying young of TB to very successful,
                  and wealthy immigrants to dying as paupers. Today they are
                  still known as the Belford Brothers of Toronto. One of the
                  ideas they had was to reprint expensive encyclopedias and
                  famous written works and to sell the books cheaply for common
                  people. This led to Mark Twain taking my family to court and
                  loosing but this court case began the fight for laws to
                  prevent plagiarism.

                  I thought since I was asking someone on “Find A Grave” to find
                  and post a photograph of my ancestor I should do the same for
                  others. I began to answer requests and then everything
                  changed. This small idea in 2007 started by taking pictures
                  line by line and began to grow in size, and meaning, as time
                  went on. The most motivating factor in creating this project
                  was how blessed I felt to have been given a second chance at
                  life, and now I could help others. Joe Stypa a P.T. who
                  treated my injuries first and next and Dr. Castiglia, a
                  neurosurgeon who addressed my all of my back injuries. I am
                  grateful everyday now that my ability to function and walk
                  normally and has been restored and I am paying forward. I
                  chose St. Stanislaus Cemetery for my project because 5
                  generations of my Polish/German ancestors are buried there.
                  The couple who began it all, Franciszek Nurek, Nórek was born
                  in Pogutkin Germany (now Pogótki Poland) immigrated to
                  Vevango, Pa and then onto Buffalo, NY. with his younger
                  children. Frank’s oldest son John, my great-grandfather, born
                  in Pinschin Germany (now Pinczyn Poland), immigrated with his
                  wife to live in Buffalo, and this is how my story began. I
                  hope everyone enjoys my project!

                  <strong> Disclaimer:</strong> My index is a resource for those
                  looking for more information on those buried at Saint
                  Stanislaus Cemetery. Saint Stanislaus Cemetery is not
                  responsible for any errors in transcriptions. Please use the
                  contact us page to let us know if there are any corrections
                  that may need updating. Only transcription mistakes will be
                  changed. All given and surname spellings as well as dates
                  found in the ledger will remain the same as listed in St
                  Stanislaus ledgers. Death certificates all include the name of
                  the cemetery a person is buried in. If you have a death
                  certificate listing St Stanislaus on Pine Ridge Rd Cheektowaga
                  as the place of burial and you do not find their name in this
                  index then it could be one of two things….they may be buried
                  in a section that I have not completed or they could be listed
                  on 3×5 cards in the office and not been entered into a ledger.
                  I have not gone through the 3×5 cards myself but when
                  searching names on stones I did find names on these cards that
                  had not been entered into a ledger.
