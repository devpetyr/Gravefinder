                        Through my image locator you will be able to find photos
                        & information regarding lost friends or relatives &
                        their final resting places. The search feature allows
                        you to submit a query by last name or date of birth or
                        death. I display all of the information that I’ve
                        compiled including multiple photos of a grave site, plot
                        where it’s located, date deceased, military service if
                        any, any possible alternative or Americanized spellings
                        of the name. The information from my index does NOT
                        coordinate with the official St Stanislaus map. I have
                        created my own maps that do coordinate with my index. In
                        many instances I have REVERSED LINES IN ORDER to make
                        FINDING STONES EASIER! My maps are intended to exactly
                        find STONES. WHEN POSSIBLE I will indicate where a
                        burial is located that doesn’t have a stone by the
                        following number, example 3+. That tells you count 3
                        stones and the next spot to stone#3 is the 3+ spot. In
                        some cases there could be a large area in the line
                        without stones and several people in the line would be
                        listed as 3+. Bottom line that burial is before the 4th
                        stone. Paces are indicated when there are few stones
                        standing to use as a guide in locating lines. Paces are
                        found on the old side. They may indicate how many steps
                        from the road or how many steps in between stones in
                        order for you to follow a straight line. On the Old Side
                        after decades of rain, mud and small stones moving
                        downhill as well as stones falling the only person who
                        can truly tell you where bodies are buried is David
                        Szyjka. Therefore after spending months in each and
                        every section and if I can’t find where a burial is
                        located I have NOT LISTED a line number. You will find
                        on the search the first VISIBLE surname on the line. You
                        will find the line number COORDINATED with MY MAPS,
                        again not ST STANS MAPS. The total number of stones in
                        each line is listed and then I tell you the number in
                        the line where the stone is that you are looking for if
                        possible. The office cannot help you with my index but
                        If it’s easier you can go to the office and they can
                        assist you with their system. I welcome you to enjoy &
                        share this Guide and Resource. I would like to take this
                        opportunity to thank all of the people that helped to
                        make this project possible. David Szyjka, the Director
                        of St. Stanislaus Cemetery allowed this project to
                        happen. David’s secretaries, Julie and Joanne, for their
                        patience and time searching dates. The cemetery workers
                        hard work keeping up the grounds helped me to take great
                        pictures. Doug Nichy, my I.T. person, who taught me
                        Excel and kept my computer running. Lillia Biszko
                        Leszczynski spent many hours translating my Cyrillic
                        stone’s. Dolores Ferguson a member of the P.G.S. (Polish
                        Genealogy Society) helped me with Polish translations.
                        Maureen Gleason, a P.G.S. member, spent many hours in
                        the cemetery brainstorming. Sharon Umiker, Bonnie Luce,
                        Steve Cornelius and Greg Wadsworth from the Maple Rd.
                        Family Research Center; all of these people are
                        dedicated researchers who have all shared their
                        experience while brainstorming, and helped to keep my
                        spirit positive. JB Thomas gave me encouragement and
                        advice about creating a website. Jackie Choninski for
                        her valued tech support. A Thank you to my family
                        Zachary Ruppert, Jaxon Conlon, Paul Noreck and to little
                        Ethan Nichy who calls me Aunt. A big thank-you to family
                        members for their understanding of the huge amount of
                        hours I have spent over many years at St Stan’s Cemetery
                        creating this project. Lastly to Rick Dombkiewicz who
                        took my vision and turned my index into a searchable
                        website. Rick spent many daunting hours creating the
                        codes needed to take my data and create this searchable
                        website. Thanks to ALL!
